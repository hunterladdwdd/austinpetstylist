            I am an NDGAA Certified Pet Stylist and owner of Austin Pet Stylist , and have made Austin home for the last 15 years.  I moved here in 2001 to attend UT Austin, and graduated with a BSN in Nursing in 2006. After working in trauma and women’s health for a few years, I realized it was time to pursue my passion for animals. A career in dog grooming was a perfect way for me to combine my love for dogs and my artistic side, and it has proven to be a dream come true.

            I have a senior Pomeranian named Gizmo, who think he’s a human and dislikes being around most other dogs. He’s my world, and I understand the close connections people have with their pets. All pets in my care are treated as if they were my own, and I understand how important that is to you.

            I previously volunteered at Austin Pets Alive! and The Humane Society as a dog walker, and currently offer pro bono grooming services to Blue Dog Rescue whenever they have a dog that needs a little TLC.

            I believe there is always more to learn when it comes to grooming. I am constantly looking for more knowledge, and have attended countless trade shows, seminars, dog shows, and classes. I am currently certified in Pet 1st Aid and CPR and a Certified Terrier Groomer through the NDGAA. I am working towards my Master Groomer Certification and hope that have that completed soon.

            I love grooming to breed standard, and smaller dogs are my specialty. Some of my favorite breeds to groom are Pomeranians, Yorkies, Poodles, Wire Fox Terriers, Australian Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, or creative or personality trims on mixed-breed dogs.

            I'm a professional pet stylist of 7 years, and I can't think of a better career for me!

            I have loved dogs since I was a baby; my first word was "Teddy" my Scottish Terrier's name. I read every book on dogs I could find when I was young, spent countless hours teaching Patsy the family dog tricks and brushing her, and was obsessed with trying to get my parents to let me have my own puppy.

            I became a groomer at 18 after attending Petsmart Grooming Academy. Since then, I have attended many seminars and hands-on workshops, earned my First Aid and CPR certification, and competed in grooming competitions where I earned several first place wins. I am currently working towards earning my National Certified Master Groomer title through the National Dog Groomer's Association of America.

            I have experience in many breeds, my favorite being the poodle, any size. I even have my own poodle-kids, a Miniature poodle, Trevvor, and a Toy Poodle, Raven. I specialize in scissor trims, but also have experience in handstripping terriers and spaniels.

            I look forward to working with you and your furkid to find that perfect personalized style you've been looking for!

            I moved to Austin in 2014 from Stockton, CA with my 11-year old daughter Emilee to pursue a career I was passionate about – dog grooming. I have always loved dogs and knew it would be a great career for me. I am certified in Pet CPR and 1st Aid and have years of experience working for dog in various boarding facilities as well as a vet’s office.

            When I am not working, you can find me at the dog park with by dog Toby (Bernese mix) and family. My dog Toby was a rescue, and has been by my side for a number of years. He is obsessed with squirrels and sunbathing, and loves to swim when he can. Squeaky toys are his favorite, but then he destroys them and gets sad about it.

            I also live with my sister and her two dachshunds, Bean and Romeo. I couldn’t imagine my life without dogs, and I am happy to be a part of the Austin Pet Stylist team!

            My name is Gizmo Marie Joy (yes, my middle name is Marie, get over it!) and I am obviously the most
            important person on this bio page. I prefer to believe other dogs don’t exist, but since my mom seems to like them so much I guess I have to work with it.

            My favorite things are squirrels and walkies, and sometimes I like to cuddle with my people. I like to perch up high on the couch and lick my paws to clean my gloriously puffy face like a cat-dog!
          %blockquote
            If you catch me in my pocket bed please leave me alone, unless you are giving me a “treat-treat”. I just want to sleep. I’ll tell you when it’s cuddle time. Sometimes I can get quite demanding! 
          %blockquote
            I may not love being groomed but my mom is sure good at it! Sometimes she makes my paws too puffy 
            though, and I need to lick them to flatten them out and fix her work.
